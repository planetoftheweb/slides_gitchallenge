# Removing Untracked Files

> >

You can easily use git checkout . to rewind a commit to it's latest state, but that doesn't remove untracked documents, if you have a project where you've added some folders and or files, how do you get rid of not just the last few changes, but also untracked files?

I'll give you a couple of seconds to think about how you'd do something like this.

Git has a set of commands to take care of this called clean.

It's pretty simple. All you do is issue a git clean command with some flags.

```
git clean -f
```
