# Picking Specific Commits

Let's say you are working on a branch to update some of the libraries you're using on your project. You update bootstrap, and made several commits to bring things up to date, then moved on to the next library. However after a bit, you realize that it would be fine to bring some of those commits over to main. How do you bring only specific commits from one branch to another?

I'll give you a couple of seconds to think about how you'd do something like this.

# Solution

What I would do here, is to use a feature called cherry picking. Cherry picking allows you to pick specific commits from a branch and move them to another branch.
