# Marking items without branching

Most projects have what we call a main branch in which the history of the project lives, ocassionally, you need a way to establish that certain commits are finished a versions of the project. How does git help you do that?

I'll give you a couple of gitseconds to think about how you'd do something like this.

The answer to that is tags. Git lets you create an identifier for a specific commit that lets you identify when you've reached a version of a project. In GitHub you see that as release.

git tag v2.0.1
git tag -a v2.0.3 -m "Updated to Bootstrap 5"

-a creates a tag that is annotated with additional metadata. You can include a message with this tag with some more details.
