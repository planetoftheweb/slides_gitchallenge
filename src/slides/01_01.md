# Creating projects from repos

> >

You want clone an existing repository, but you don't need all of the history of commits and logs. Perhaps it's an older project with a rich history. How do you clone a repository with a limited history?

I'll give you a couple of seconds to think about how you'd do something like this.

# Solution

This is called a shallow clone and the command is pretty simple:

```
git clone --depth=N <repo>
```

git clone, then the depth flag and a number that starts at one, but can be the number of commits you want to include...finally, the URL of the repo.


```sh
cd ~/Desktop
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/LinkedInLearning/css-scrolling-parallax-2835103
git log
```

This way, it will download a lot faster.

# Conclusion

We can use this on this course to copy a repo to use for this course, although you can use this with any repo.
