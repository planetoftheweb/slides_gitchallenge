# Creating a Safety Net for Fixes

Let's say that you valiantly did a git reset with the hard flag and then panic strikes...You realize that you didn't mean to do that. Is there any way to undo a hard reset?

I'll give you a couple of seconds to think about how you'd do something like this.

Have no fear, advanced users know of another command that keeps track of all your changes...even the ones you seemingly screwed up.
