# Multiple remotes

Sometimes, it's good to be able to send your work to more than one location, but how do you manage to send changes to more than one repo?

I'll give you a couple of seconds to think about how you'd do something like this.

The answer is managing remotes. You're probably used to adding your remote when you first create a repo by adding an origin.

```
git remote add NAME URL
git remote add origin URL
git remote remove origin URL
git remote get-url origin URL
git remote set-url origin URL
```

You can add as many remotes as you want and this is useful for putting your work in different places. You might, for example have a remote that you use for development and a different one you push for production.
