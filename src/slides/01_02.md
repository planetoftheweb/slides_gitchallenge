# Fixing the last commit

> >

Sometimes you do a 'commit', but you immediately realize that you need to change one more thing. Instead of doing a new commit with a different message, how you do add something to a previous commit?

I'll give you a couple of seconds to think about how you'd do something like this.

# Solution

Again, this one's pretty easy and is called ammending your commit.

I'm updating the version of Bootstrap on this site. Let's make sure we bump the version number to 1.0.2.

Now let's add that and commit it

git add . && git commit -m "Bump Bootstrap to 1.0.2"

Cool. Now let's take a peek at the commit history.



```
git commit --amend
git commit --amend -m "Change message"
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

There are three options. You can issue the --amend command, which will open up an editor for your to modify the commit message.

You can also use the --no-edit flag, which just uses the last commit message.

Finally, you can add your own message. In that case it will modify the existing message.

One interesting thing is that if you check the log.

git log.

# Conclusion

Warning! This isn't really safe for commits that have already been pushed. That's because someone may have already cloned the old commit and it could be confusing.
