# Identifying Changes

In a multi-user environment with a large history is harder to detect when the changes were made by an individual. How would you look for specific changes that only you made to a specific line of text?

I'll give you a couple of seconds to think about how you'd do something like this.

# Solution


Alright, that's just perfect for the git blame command. It's sort of the cousin of the git log command, but it works on individual files and gives you more information about who changed what on a specific file.

Let's check out our index.html file to see who has made changes to it.

```sh
git blame build/index.html
```
Now, that's pretty good, but it's a bit verbose. Let's take a look at a little see information with the -s flag.

```sh
git blame -s build/index.html
```
This will hide the names of the people who have made changes.

You can also request a certain line number

```
git blame -s -L 16 ./build/index.html
```

# Conclusion

Git blame is quite useful for scoping out line number changes or to figure out who's done a specific commit, so it's a good one to know when you're trying to figure things out.
