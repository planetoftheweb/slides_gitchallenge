# Renaming Branches

In the old days, it was common to name the main branch master, today it's common to call them main. How do you change an older project to use a different name and set up your environment to use main as default.

I'll give you a couple of seconds to think about how you'd do something like this.

The first part is easy, you just need to rename the master branch.

git branch -mv main
