# Working on Multiple Branches

You're working hard on a new feature and your boss calls you all of a sudden and needs you to jump to another feature branch. Is there a way to work on more than one branch at the same time?

I'll give you a couple of seconds to think about how you'd do something like this.

You may have been thinking about using stashes and that would be fine, but worktrees are a bit more powerful. They let you have different copies of the same project at different branches.


```
git worktree add ../03_02b
git worktree lis
git worktree lock
git worktree move
git worktree prune
git worktree remove
git worktree unlock
```
